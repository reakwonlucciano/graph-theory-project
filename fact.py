Graph isomorphism is an equivalence relation on graphs and as such it partitions the class of all graphs into equivalence classes. A set of graphs isomorphic to each other is called an isomorphism class of graphs
In graph theory, an isomorphism of graphs G and H is a bijection between the vertex sets of G and H
